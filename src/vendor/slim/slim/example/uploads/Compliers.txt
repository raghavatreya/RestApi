Ambigutiy Problem is undecideable we have to try all possibility.
Guess and solve the problem
(2^3)^4
make it right associative.
f=g^f|g
+ and * make them left associative.
and or boolean make them left associative
not make them right associative.
sum product and kleen closure of two expresssion
$ is left associative.
# is left recursevive.
Left recursion and right recursion.
A = Aa | b
A is calling itself and doing somework a.
Top Down Parser does not work with left recursive grammer.
ambigus and unambigus 
determistic A = aB1 | aB2  | aB3 and nondeterminstic
left recursive  and right recursive
left factoring proccess in this process we have to take decision at the base of beta1,beta2,beta3
on sceing enough postpone the decision making step
A = aA'
A'=B1 | B2 | B3
