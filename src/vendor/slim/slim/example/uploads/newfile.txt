What's included?

When exploring the application, these are the key files to look at.

index.php instantiates the Slim application object, sets the application up using files in app/ and runs it.
app/dependencies.php contains all the dependencies that are registered with Pimple.
app/middleware.php is where you should register any application middleware that you want to use. It's empty in the skeleton.
app/routes.php contains all the routes that the application responds to. I like having them all in one place and to keep the file sensible, I use the DIC to grab the action for dispatch.
app/src/Action/HomeAction.php is the class that is loaded by the DIC and then the dispatch method is executed. The nice thing about having a class like this is that I can load the dependencies via the constructor. Look in dependencies.php for the factory for this class.
app/templates/home.twig is the Twig view script that is rendered.
